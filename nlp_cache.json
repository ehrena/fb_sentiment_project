Tomorrow, not only do I leave home behind, but also an addiction. To all my friends and peers reading this (or skimming), please understand that this is what I have to do. I have to make a promise to myself and those around me that I am making a change. To those of you who chew tobacco or have family or friends who do, this is for you. About a year and a half ago, I tried Skoal wintergreen smokeless tobacco pouches. Chewing tobacco (or dip) culture in baseball declined a few decades ago, only to surge back into popularity over the past 15 years. The highest levels of the game have made significant effort to limit the use of chew or dip and to educate about the adverse effects and promote alternatives such as gum, sunflower seeds and herbal snuff. After all of these endeavors, dip is still at large in the game of baseball and throughout other sports such as football and hockey. For me, I was hooked right away. I started dipping 3, 4, and sometimes five times a day. I remember days down south at baseball tournaments where I did it so much I couldn't keep track. It was mindless. To all the smokers and dippers out there, think about how many times nicotine has hypnotized you into feeding the addiction. I am someone who likes to feel in control, but I uncharacteristically let myself lose control multiple times a day. When my parents found out last summer, it was a mess. I had never seen my dad truly ashamed in me until that day. I told them that I was addicted and promised to stop. That didn't go well. After a month of abstaining, I relapsed. I continued to use covertly for several months. Without any of my family knowing, there was very little guilt, so it made it easier for me to make bad decisions. These scenarios continued over the following year. I've never seen so many concerned family members and friends, and I've never seen my mother cry as much as she did. I didn't really understand why until today as I sat in an oral surgeon's office. He told me I'm probably fine, but that I have a small white patch on the inside of my gum called leukoplakia. Most dippers develop these, but some can be pre-cancerous or cancerous. As soon as I heard that, I said \"I'm done\". That was it. Months of therapy, tears and begging. All it took was some cold hard facts, and the knowledge that a pointless habit has left a potentially lethal mark on me. I love baseball. I love country music. I love Diet Mountain Dew. I really loved dip. Despite my urban upbringing, baseball turns me into quite the hick. While all those other hobbies are fun, dip is certainly not worth it. I do not intend to get buried by my parents and brother for something so trivial and pointless. Fuck that. I intend to live a long life. I am leaving for one of the best universities in the world tomorrow morning, and I don't want to worry about getting mouth cancer while I'm at it. So parents, don't just discourage smoking, make sure to do the same for smokeless (especially for those of you with young boys). I have not and will never pick up a cigarette (my grandmother smoked 2 packs a day for 55 years, and I begged her to stop until she did), but I somehow thought chewing carcinogens was cool. God knows where I got that logic, but I'm glad I realize how stupid I was. To boys considering trying dip, don't. It's fun, but you will smell bad, your teeth will look gross and most of your girlfriends will break up with you. I'm done. I just wish I never started.

This is gonna be stressful. First of all, I'd like to acknowledge that I know my opinion doesn't mean shit because first of all, I can't vote, and second of all, New York's not even close. However, if it did, I fully support Obama not because I love him, because I don't think he did a great job in his first term, but unlike Mr. Romney, he is able to address the social issues *cough*Gay Marriage, Abortion, Separation between church and state*cough*. Yes, Obama increased the deficit, but he had to get us out of a war we should have never taken part in (Iraq), we are in the worst financial position since the depression and our right-wing congress gave him very little help so a lot of his ideas were shut down. I can't say too much about \"Obamacare\" because I am not too well informed on every detail, but I guess some people don't like it very much, but it's better than having Romney, who will lower taxes for the rich and raise taxes on the middle class, and that makes very little sense. Just because Romney is too selfish to give up a portion of his income despite the fact that he has enough money to wipe his ass with sheets of gold, his avid supporter Donald Trump can also resonate with that as he is so greedy, that he would probably would take up Stephen Colbert's 1 million dollar offer to dip his balls in Trump's mouth. I happen to like neither, but with Romney's social plan, and his general sense of morality, I don't see how anybody could vote for him, I mean, no offense intended to his supporters, but I personally think the fact that a really significant portion of our country supports him over Obama is really just a joke.
