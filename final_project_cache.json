Along with most New Yorkers, I know (way too) many people that lost someone 15 years ago. To those people: I love you all. Be strong. You are all warriors.\nThere is no community that I am more proud of than the one I have in NYC. There is no community that I know that is more resilient. In spite of all responsibilities and self-interest, we are of city of one on  9/11. We are a diverse, unique, and brilliant 8 million person family, and no amount of hatred or fear can change that. \nNever forget.", "created_time": "2016-09-11T15:39:19+0000", "id": "10204799589621457_10209429414204178"}, {"story": "Andrew Ehrenberg shared news.com.au's video.", "created_time": "2016-09-07T13:09:10+0000", "id": "10204799589621457_10209391479615837"}, {"message": "Happy 16th (not so) little man. \nThanks for being the dopest of brothers and the best friend I could ask for.\nYou're gonna kill junior year and we're gonna kill it in Ann Arbor when you come visit \ud83d\ude09\nMuch love lil bro\u2764\ufe0f", "created_time": "2016-09-05T13:47:33+0000", "id": "10204799589621457_10209372943552447"}, {"message": "Ho\u303d\ufe0fies", "story": "Andrew Ehrenberg is at Delta Chi Michigan Chapter.", "created_time": "2016-09-01T17:30:39+0000", "id": "10204799589621457_10209335327572071"}, {"message": "Wow", "story": "Andrew Ehrenberg shared Baseball & Softball around the World's video.", "created_time": "2016-08-28T15:54:36+0000", "id": "10204799589621457_10209295172968231"}, {"message": "Thank you Luis LoudMouth Camacho for the nomination.\nI know this is just the next social media fad, but given the cause I had to oblige.\n22 veterans commit suicide every day.

Who cares if she takes the subway? If you were the secretary of state and worth millions of dollars, you might not take the subway either. This is a classic example of how the Sanders team and my generation frame Hillary as elitist, inadequately fluent in pop culture, and ingenuine. While this video is funny on the surface, it really isn't, because hitting share and tagging all of your friends is worsening the already existing problems with the media.

As co-philanthropy chair of Delta Chi along with my good friend Justin Kaplan, we are EXTREMELY excited to finally announce our upcoming event to support another good friend of ours, Marco Gutierrez in his battle against leukemia. We've worked extremely hard to make this as dope as possible. Looking forward to everybody enjoying the madness, supporting Marco, and ballin out #marcostrong\nHere some info about the event:\nMarco Madness is raising money for treating pediatric leukemia through the Children\u2019s National Medical Center in Washington D.C. Children\u2019s National is currently the only health system designed for kids in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area.With your help, and donations, we can help fund the fight against pediatric leukemia. This philanthropy event honors Marco Gutierrez, a freshmen at the University of Michigan, who was forced to leave school shortly after arriving due to the remission of his Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. Marco courageously fought through treatment of A.L.L. for three years of his life in high school prior to coming to Michigan. He currently is at home fighting hard to recover so that he can return to Michigan in the fall. Marco is a loving, caring, courageous, and truly inspirational friend and individual. We want to support Marco to beat his leukemia like the first time, as well as support everyone else who suffers from these horrible diseases.", "story": "Andrew Ehrenberg updated his cover photo.", "created_time": "2016-03-30T18:01:21+0000", "id": "10204799589621457_10208119596299549"}, {"story": "Andrew Ehrenberg shared a link.", "created_time": "2016-03-28T23:12:49+0000", "id": "10204799589621457_10208094533592997"}, {"message": "Love it", "story": "Andrew Ehrenberg shared Bleacher Report's post.", "created_time": "2016-03-18T16:39:11+0000", "id": "10204799589621457_10207958966523905"}, {"message": "My squad>", "story": "Andrew Ehrenberg is with Lauren Schwabe and 5 others.", "created_time": "2016-03-16T13:41:57+0000", "id": "10204799589621457_10207938201964804"}, {"message": "Didn't know what Roger Ehrenberg and Carin Levine Ehrenberg meant until the past semester and a half.

Tomorrow, not only do I leave home behind, but also an addiction. To all my friends and peers reading this (or skimming), please understand that this is what I have to do. I have to make a promise to myself and those around me that I am making a change. To those of you who chew tobacco or have family or friends who do, this is for you. About a year and a half ago, I tried Skoal wintergreen smokeless tobacco pouches. Chewing tobacco (or dip) culture in baseball declined a few decades ago, only to surge back into popularity over the past 15 years. The highest levels of the game have made significant effort to limit the use of chew or dip and to educate about the adverse effects and promote alternatives such as gum, sunflower seeds and herbal snuff. After all of these endeavors, dip is still at large in the game of baseball and throughout other sports such as football and hockey. For me, I was hooked right away. I started dipping 3, 4, and sometimes five times a day. I remember days down south at baseball tournaments where I did it so much I couldn't keep track. It was mindless. To all the smokers and dippers out there, think about how many times nicotine has hypnotized you into feeding the addiction. I am someone who likes to feel in control, but I uncharacteristically let myself lose control multiple times a day. When my parents found out last summer, it was a mess. I had never seen my dad truly ashamed in me until that day. I told them that I was addicted and promised to stop. That didn't go well. After a month of abstaining, I relapsed. I continued to use covertly for several months. Without any of my family knowing, there was very little guilt, so it made it easier for me to make bad decisions. These scenarios continued over the following year. I've never seen so many concerned family members and friends, and I've never seen my mother cry as much as she did. I didn't really understand why until today as I sat in an oral surgeon's office. He told me I'm probably fine, but that I have a small white patch on the inside of my gum called leukoplakia. Most dippers develop these, but some can be pre-cancerous or cancerous. As soon as I heard that, I said \"I'm done\". That was it. Months of therapy, tears and begging. All it took was some cold hard facts, and the knowledge that a pointless habit has left a potentially lethal mark on me. I love baseball. I love country music. I love Diet Mountain Dew. I really loved dip. Despite my urban upbringing, baseball turns me into quite the hick. While all those other hobbies are fun, dip is certainly not worth it. I do not intend to get buried by my parents and brother for something so trivial and pointless. Fuck that. I intend to live a long life. I am leaving for one of the best universities in the world tomorrow morning, and I don't want to worry about getting mouth cancer while I'm at it. So parents, don't just discourage smoking, make sure to do the same for smokeless (especially for those of you with young boys). I have not and will never pick up a cigarette (my grandmother smoked 2 packs a day for 55 years, and I begged her to stop until she did), but I somehow thought chewing carcinogens was cool. God knows where I got that logic, but I'm glad I realize how stupid I was. To boys considering trying dip, don't. It's fun, but you will smell bad, your teeth will look gross and most of your girlfriends will break up with you. I'm done. I just wish I never started.

Seriously, these remarks were not yours to make, and not anyone else's to make either. Just lets Collins do what he wants to do, and what makes him happy, what he did was brave. People like Chris Broussard are the reason that we aren't making any progress as an accepting country and world. A respect, and well known sports figure yet again shows that our world is screwed up, and people that don't interpret the bible for what it is can just shove it. I think everyone's opinion should be valued, with exception this opinion, because it is just ridiculous. It does not concern anyone, it does not concern God and it most certainly does not concern Chris Broussard. God did not create a world so that there could be hatred; he created love, tolerance and acceptance, and how we choose to interpret things like this dictates our progress as global citizens and people.

This is gonna be stressful. First of all, I'd like to acknowledge that I know my opinion doesn't mean shit because first of all, I can't vote, and second of all, New York's not even close. However, if it did, I fully support Obama not because I love him, because I don't think he did a great job in his first term, but unlike Mr. Romney, he is able to address the social issues *cough*Gay Marriage, Abortion, Separation between church and state*cough*. Yes, Obama increased the deficit, but he had to get us out of a war we should have never taken part in (Iraq), we are in the worst financial position since the depression and our right-wing congress gave him very little help so a lot of his ideas were shut down. I can't say too much about \"Obamacare\" because I am not too well informed on every detail, but I guess some people don't like it very much, but it's better than having Romney, who will lower taxes for the rich and raise taxes on the middle class, and that makes very little sense. Just because Romney is too selfish to give up a portion of his income despite the fact that he has enough money to wipe his ass with sheets of gold, his avid supporter Donald Trump can also resonate with that as he is so greedy, that he would probably would take up Stephen Colbert's 1 million dollar offer to dip his balls in Trump's mouth. I happen to like neither, but with Romney's social plan, and his general sense of morality, I don't see how anybody could vote for him, I mean, no offense intended to his supporters, but I personally think the fact that a really significant portion of our country supports him over Obama is really just a joke.

Her father had lost his job and the only way he could find new employment was by moving to a new state the relocation caused a lot of problems for Carmen. She had to leave her friends behind and attend a whole new school in Indiana. Carmen had a hard time making friends when she changed schools. It was the middle of the school year and most of the students had no interest in befriending the new girl. Initially, she spent many days alone, walking from class to class without speaking to anyone, but she eventually started hanging around with a group of five other girls. Carmen thought these girls were her friends, but it wasn\u2019t long before she discovered that they had been talking about her behind her back and spreading vile rumors.\n\nWhen she confronted them, the girls turned on her and began bullying her every day, making her life a misery. They started out calling her names, but then the bullying got much worse. One day, she left her school books in the classroom at break time. When shereturned, she found someone had taken a sharpie and written dirty words all over her books. Another day, she opened her bag and discovered someone had poured yoghurt all over the insides. Sometimes, she would come to school and find her locker had been vandalized. The final straw came when she put on her coat at recess and found that someone had stuffed dog poop in her pockets.\n\nThere and then, Carmen decided that she couldn\u2019t take the bullying any longer. She planned to stay behind, that evening, after school, and tell her teacher what had been happening. Unfortunately, her decision came too late to save her life.\n\nAfter lunch, her teacher announced that the school was holding a fire drill. When the alarm sounded, Carmen and the other students filed out of the classroom and assembled in the yard outside. As the teachers read out the roll call, the gang of five girls decided that this was a great opportunity to embarrass Carmen in front of the whole school during the fire drill. They moved over to where Carmen was standing, near a sewer drain, and began crowding the poorgirl, getting in her face and nudging her towards the open manhole.\n\nThey pushed her and she tripped over and fell head-first down the manhole. When they saw her falling, the girls started giggling and when Carmen\u2019s name was called out, they shouted \"She\u2019s down in the sewer!\"\n\nAll of the other students began laughing. But when the teachers looked down the manhole and saw Carmen\u2019s body lying at the bottom in the muck and the poop, the laughter abruptly stopped. Her head was twisted around at an odd angle and her face was covered in blood. Worse still, she wasn\u2019t moving. There was nothing any of the teachers could do for her. Carmen was dead. When the police arrived and went down into the sewer, they determined that she had broken her neck. Her face had been torn off when she hit the ladder on the way down and her neck snapped when she landed on her head on the concrete at the bottom.\n\nThe police hauled Carmen\u2019s body out of the sewer and sent her to the mortuary. Everyone had to stay behind after school while the police questioned all of Carmen\u2019s classmates. The five girlslied to the police, saying they had witnessed Carmen falling down the sewer. The police believed the girls and Carmen Winstead\u2019s death was ruled an accident and the case was closed. Everyone thought that was the last they would hear of Carmen Winstead, but they were wrong.\n\nMonths later, Carmen\u2019s classmates began receiving strange e-mails on their MySpaces. The e-mails were titled \"They Pushed Her\" and claimed that Carmen hadn\u2019t really fallen down the sewer, she had been pushed. The e-mails also warned that the guilty people should own up and take responsibility for their crime. If they didn\u2019t there would be horrible consequences. Most people dismissed the e-mails as a hoax, but others were not so sure.\n\nA few days later, one of the girls who pushed Carmen down the sewer was at home taking a shower, when she heard a strange cackling laugh. It seemed to be coming from the drain. The girl started to freak out and ran out of the bathroom. That night, the girl said goodnight to her mom and went to sleep. Five hours later, her mom was awoken in the middle of the night, by a loudnoise that resounded throughout the house. She ran into her daughter\u2019s room, only to find it empty. There was no trace of the girl. The worried mother called the police and when they arrived, they conducted a search of the area. Eventually, they discovered the girl\u2019s grisly remains.\n\nHer corpse was lying in the sewer, covered in muck and poop. Her neck was broken and her face missing. It had been completely torn off. One by one, all of the girls who pushed Carmen that day were found dead. They had all been killed in exactly the same way and were all found at exactly the same spot. In the sewer at the bottom of the same uncovered manhole where Carmen had met her doom. But the killing didn\u2019t stop there. More and more of Carmen\u2019s former classmates were found dead. It seemed that anyone who didn\u2019t believe that Carmen had been pushed, was eventually found down in the sewer with their necks broken and their faces torn off.\n\nThey say that Carmen\u2019s ghost is still on the rampage, hunting down anyone who doesn\u2019t believe herstory. According to the legend, Carmen will get you, whetherit\u2019s from a toilet, a shower, a sink or a drain. When you go to sleep, you\u2019ll wake up in the sewer, in complete darkness, paralyzed, unable to move, hearing cackling laughter all around you. Then, as you scream in horror, Carmen will come and tear your face off.\n\nSo be careful who you bully, because you just might find yourself on the receiving end of the curse of Carmen Winstead.\n\nFACT: About two months later, 16-year-old David Gregory read this post and didn't repost it. When he went to take a shower, he heard laughter, started freaking out, and ran to his computer to repost it. He said goodnight to his mom and went to sleep, but five hours later, his mom woke up in the middle of the night from a loud noise and David was gone. A few hours later, the police found him in the sewer, with a broken neck and the skin on his face peeled off.\n\nEven Google her name - you'll find this to be true.\n\nIf you don't repost this saying \"They hurt her,\" then Carmen will get you, either from a sewer, the toilet, the shower", "created_time": "2011-12-05T03:54:03+0000", "id": "10204799589621457_2564781130714"}, {"message": "http://espn.go.com/college-football/rankings \ndamn i wish ok. st was in", "created_time": "2011-12-05T02:40:04+0000", "id": "10204799589621457_2564504523799"}, {"message": "Lol", "created_time": "2011-12-04T18:01:11+0000", "id": "10204799589621457_2561413086515"}, {"story": "Andrew Ehrenberg updated his profile picture.", "created_time": "2011-12-04T04:29:16+0000", "id": "10204799589621457_2557542149744"}, {"message": "lol this was a very accurate spread hahaha 48.5 smh New Mexico St", "created_time": "2011-12-04T01:57:01+0000", "id": "10204799589621457_2556722449252"}, {"message": "New flints!", "created_time": "2011-12-03T20:59:02+0000", "id": "10204799589621457_2554993606032"}, {"message": "With luca and jayson", "created_time": "2011-12-03T18:55:47+0000", "id": "10204799589621457_2554272468004"}, {"message": "Chillin with my brothas Jayson Camacho and Luca FireJawn Milstein in a few hrs", "created_time": "2011-12-03T15:52:47+0000", "id": "10204799589621457_2553076078095"}, {"message": "yo everyone in my bio class should email ms pabon tellin her they were confused about the test if u were because like half of that stuff was on the study guide and ms freeman like made that test.

I really need my friends, your friends and their friends to donate money to my cause. Whether you donate $5 or $5,000, any amount of money is going to make a difference. I have named my cause Pogo for Parkinson's because I am lucky to have the physical ability to pogo stick, and I want all my supporters to understand my dedication to the cause. I am going to pogo stick thousands of times around town with family members and friends, raising money along the way.
